Welcome to my **Advent of Code Challenge 2024** repository! This December, I embarked on a 25-day journey to solve daily programming puzzles, enhancing my problem-solving skills and exploring various programming languages.  

## 📅 About the Challenge  

**Advent of Code** is an annual event that presents a series of small programming puzzles, one each day from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle is designed to challenge and improve your coding abilities, regardless of your skill level. You can solve these puzzles in any programming language you prefer, making it a versatile and engaging way to learn and grow as a developer.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  

The repository is organized to keep track of each day's challenge systematically:  

```
Advent-of-Code-2024/  
├── Day1/  
│   ├── Day1.ipynb      # Jupyter Notebook with problem explanation and solution  
│   └── input.txt       # Input data for the day's puzzle  
├── Day2/  
│   ├── Day2.ipynb  
│   └── input.txt  
...  
├── Day25/  
│   ├── Day25.ipynb  
│   └── input.txt  
└── README.md  
```  

- **DayX/**: Each folder corresponds to a specific day of the challenge.  
  - `DayX.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the problem description, detailed explanations, and solution code.  
  - `input.txt`: The input data for the puzzle of that specific day.  

## 🛠️ Getting Started  

To follow along with my solutions or to try the challenges yourself, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-challenge.git  
   ```  

2. **Navigate to a Specific Day**  
   ```bash  
   cd Day1  
   ```  

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook Day1.ipynb  
   ```  

4. **Input Your Data**  
   - The `input.txt` file contains the puzzle's input data. If you're solving on your own, replace it with your own data file.  

5. **Explore and Contribute**  
   - Feel free to fork the repository, explore my solutions, and contribute your own approaches!
