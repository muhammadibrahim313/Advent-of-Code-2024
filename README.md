# 🎄 Advent of Code Challenge 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code Challenge 2024** repository! This December, I embarked on a 25-day journey to solve daily programming puzzles, enhancing my problem-solving skills and exploring various programming languages.

## 📅 About the Challenge

**Advent of Code** is an annual event that presents a series of small programming puzzles, one each day from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle is designed to challenge and improve your coding abilities, regardless of your skill level. You can solve these puzzles in any programming language you prefer, making it a versatile and engaging way to learn and grow as a developer.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to keep track of each day's challenge systematically:

```
Advent-of-Code-2024/
├── Day1/
│   ├── Day1.ipynb
│   └── README.md
├── Day2/
│   ├── Day2.ipynb
│   └── README.md
...
├── Day25/
│   ├── Day25.ipynb
│   └── README.md
└── README.md
```

- **DayX/**: Each folder corresponds to a specific day of the challenge.
  - `DayX.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the problem description, detailed explanations, and solution code.
  - `README.md`: A brief summary of the day's challenge and key takeaways.
