        "## Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "You are tasked with helping a group of engineers calibrate a bridge by solving equations. Each equation consists of a test value and a series of numbers. To solve the problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Determine if the test value can be produced by inserting operators (`+`, `*`, or `||`) between the numbers.\n",
        "2. The operators are evaluated **left-to-right**, disregarding operator precedence rules.\n",
        "3. The `||` operator concatenates numbers (e.g., `12 || 345` results in `12345`).\n",
        "4. The goal is to find all equations that can be made valid and compute the total calibration result, which is the sum of the test values from all valid equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, given the equation `190: 10 19`, the test value `190` can be achieved with `10 * 19`. Similarly, using concatenation, `156: 15 6` is valid as `15 || 6 = 156`.\n",
        "\n",

        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Input Parsing**\n",
        "- Each line of input contains a test value followed by a series of numbers. These are parsed into test cases for evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Operator Insertion**\n",
        "- All possible combinations of operators (`+`, `*`, `||`) are inserted between the numbers using a brute-force approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Left-to-Right Evaluation**\n",
        "- The resulting expressions are evaluated strictly from left to right, ensuring the absence of precedence rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Validation**\n",
        "- For each equation, check if any operator combination can produce the test value. If so, the equation is considered valid.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Total Calibration Result**\n",
        "- The test values of all valid equations are summed to produce the final result.\n",

This means the equations can now include three types of operations:\n",

        "1. **Addition (`+`)**\n",
        "2. **Multiplication (`*`)**\n",
        "3. **Concatenation (`||`)**: This operator combines two numbers into one by joining their digits together (e.g., `12 || 34` results in `1234`).\n",

        "The goal remains the same: you need to determine if the test value on the left side of the equation can be achieved by inserting any combination of the three operators (`+`, `*`, `||`) between the numbers. The result should be the sum of all test values that can be achieved by valid operator combinations.\n",
