        "# Problem 1 Part 2\n",
        "\n",
        "You are tasked with calculating the **sum of the ratings of all trailheads** on a topographic map.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "1. **Trailhead**: A position with height `0` where hiking trails can begin.\n",
        "2. **Hiking Trail**: A path that starts at `0`, ends at `9`, and increases by exactly `1` at each step. Only up, down, left, and right movements are allowed.\n",
        "3. **Trailhead Rating**: The number of distinct hiking trails that begin at a given trailhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Highlights\n",
        "- The rating of a trailhead is determined by the count of **unique hiking trails** starting at `0` and ending at `9`.\n",
        "- Examples:\n",
        "  - A simple map had a single trailhead with a rating of `3`.\n",
        "  - A complex map had a trailhead with a rating of `227` due to a large number of distinct trails reaching `9`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach to Solve the Problem\n",
        "1. **Parse the Input**: Convert the topographic map into a 2D grid of integers.\n",
        "2. **Identify Trailheads**: Locate all positions with height `0` in the grid.\n",
        "3. **Trail Exploration**:\n",
        "   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or similar algorithms.\n",
        "   - Start from each trailhead.\n",
        "   - Explore all valid paths incrementing from `0` to `9`.\n",
        "   - Track distinct paths to ensure each is counted only once.\n",
        "4. **Calculate Ratings**:\n",
        "   - Compute the trailhead rating for each position with height `0`.\n",
        "   - Sum all ratings.\n",
        "5. **Output**: Print the total sum of ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach ensures that all distinct trails are considered, and the total ratings are accurately computed.\n"
