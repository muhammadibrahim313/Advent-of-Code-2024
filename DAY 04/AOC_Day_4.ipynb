    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In Part 1 of challenge, i need to find all occurrences of the word \"XMAS\" in a 2D grid of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition and Strategy\n",
    "The core strategy involves:\n",
    "1. Systematically checking every cell in the grid\n",
    "2. Exploring 8 possible search directions from each cell\n",
    "3. Validating the complete \"XMAS\" word formation\n",
    "4. Counting total valid formations without removing previous matches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "- `count_xmas_occurrences()`: Main function to count \"XMAS\" occurrences\n",
    "- `search_direction()`: Validates word formation in a specific direction\n",
    "- Supports searching in 8 different directions:\n",
    "  - Horizontal (left and right)\n",
    "  - Vertical (up and down)\n",
    "  - 4 Diagonal directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Approach\n",
    "1. Create a grid from input file\n",
    "2. Iterate through each cell in the grid\n",
    "3. Check all 8 possible directions from the current cell\n",
    "4. If \"XMAS\" is found in a direction, increment the count\n",
    "5. Return the total number of occurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "- O(rows * cols * directions * word_length)\n",
    "- Thoroughly checks every possible formation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Notes\n",
    "- Handles grid boundary conditions\n",
    "- Supports flexible word search\n",
    "- Counts overlapping occurrences\n",
    "- Simple and straightforward implementation\n",
